# PacketLossLogging
This Powershell script can monitor the amount of packet loss to desination addresses. This works by pinging the desitnation a configurable number of times and recording the result. I am using this with Windows Scheduled Tasks to run as often as I need.

Results will be stored in a .txt file by using "PacketLossTest -Destination "(Your destination)"" at the end of the script. Results will be stored in a .csv file by using "PacketLossTestCSV -Destination "(Your destination)"" at the end of the script. Results will be stored in both a .txt and .csv file by using "PacketLossTestTXTandCSV -Destination "(Your destination)"" at the end of the script. The first time this script is ran it will create the file(s) with the packet loss results. Additional runs will add the results to the end of the file. Each destination will have its own files. The number of pings can be changed by adjusting the variable $NumberOfPings near the beginning of the script.
